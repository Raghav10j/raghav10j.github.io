<p>(Last Updated: Oct 8, 2023)</p>

<p> I am an incoming research associate at the National Centre for Text Mining at the University of Manchester, where I work under Dr. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=quhi-K0AAAAJ&hl=en">Sophia Ananiadou</a> exploring the scientific document understanding capabilities of large language models (LLMs).</p>

<p> I also currently collaborate with the <a href="http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~tvg/">Oxford TVG Lab</a> (Philip Torr)and Meta researchers (<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HX0BfLYAAAAJ&hl=en">Ser Nam Lim</a>) on identifying and mitigating the potential for influence operations on social media using LLMs.</p>

<p>My past research experience includes working with the joint NLP Lab of IIT Patna and IIT Bombay under the guidance of <a href="https://www.iitp.ac.in/~sriparna/">Dr. Sriparna Saha</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?hl=en&user=vvg-pAkAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate">Dr. Pushpak Bhattacharyya</a>. There, I work on a variety of NLP problems and collaborate with researchers from Microsoft, the University of Tokyo, and Amazon Alexa. More broadly, I worked on online safety, AI integrity, and user analytics. This encompasses projects such as developing advanced AI-powered content moderation techniques, testing the boundaries of LLMs, and implementing AI across sectors including education, law, and healthcare.</p>

<p>I received my undergraduate degree from <a href="http://www.dtu.ac.in/">Delhi Technological University</a> in Software Engineering in 2021.</p>

<p>My research focuses on developing techniques to ensure generative AI systems are safe, ethical, and socially responsible as their capabilities continue to rapidly advance. I am particularly interested in studying and mitigating the potential societal impacts of increasingly powerful generative models, with specific emphasis on the following aspects:
<li>Investigating techniques to detect and mitigate potential misuse of generative AI for harmful purposes like spreading misinformation, toxicity, and influence operations on social media. Exploring best practices to develop generative models resilient to malicious applications.</li>
<li>Analyzing sources of social bias in generative models, including assessing impacts of training data. Researching methods to measure, understand, and reduce inherent biases in order to make generative systems more fair and inclusive. Evaluating approaches for enabling models to "forget" or override harmful biases.</li>
<li>Advancing understanding of large language model training dynamics and interpretability. Studying how linguistic relationships emerge and features interact during the training process.</li><p>




<p>I also am a member of the <a href="https://care-program.github.io">CARE program</a>. It is a <b>C</b>ommunity for <b>A</b>I <b>R</b>esearch and <b>E</b>ducation, where you can get in touch with highly-quallified mentors who can try to help out with your research-related queries.</p>
